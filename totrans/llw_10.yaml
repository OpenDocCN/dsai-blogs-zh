- en: Given an unlabeled dataset $\mathcal{U}$ and a fixed amount of labeling cost
    $B$, active learning aims to select a subset of $B$ examples from $\mathcal{U}$
    to be labeled such that they can result in maximized improvement in model performance.
    This is an effective way of learning especially when data labeling is difficult
    and costly, e.g. medical images. This classical [survey paper](https://burrsettles.com/pub/settles.activelearning.pdf)
    in 2010 lists many key concepts. While some conventional approaches may not apply
    to deep learning, discussion in this post mainly focuses on deep neural models
    and training in batch mode.
